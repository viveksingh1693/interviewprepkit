 * Provides classes related to the Prototype Design Pattern.

package com.viv.creationaldesignpattern.prototypedesignpattern;
// This package is designed to demonstrate the Prototype Design Pattern,
// which allows for the creation of new objects by copying existing ones.
// The Prototype Design Pattern is useful when the cost of creating a new object is more expensive than copying an existing one.
// It typically involves a base class or interface with a clone method,
// and concrete classes that implement this method to return a copy of themselves.
// The package may include classes such as Prototype, ConcretePrototype, and Client,
// which interact to demonstrate the cloning process.
// The Prototype Design Pattern is particularly useful in scenarios where object creation is resource-intensive,
// and it allows for more flexible and efficient object management.
// "Prototype is helpful when creating a new object is costly and 
// you want to copy an existing one instead. Compared to Factory and Builder,
//  Prototype focuses on cloning rather than construction or type selection. 
// I understand shallow cloning copies object references, while deep cloning 
// duplicates nested objects to maintain full independence. If asked to code, I can create a deep clone by ensuring all reference fields also implement clone(). However, I'm also aware of its downsides in Java, like the awkward Cloneable interface, and I often prefer copy constructors or the builder pattern in real-world code."
